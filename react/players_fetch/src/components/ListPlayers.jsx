 * Student instructions:
 *
 * This component is used to display a list of players. It receives getPlayer and players as props.
 *
 * Create the component that you did in Vue now with React. Use provided props to handle user events. Find and replace functionality with React equivalents.
 *
 * NOTE: use the same ids, classes and html elements as you did in Vue. Refer to tests in the __tests__ folder to pass the unit tests, and to the cypress/e2e folder for the end-to-end tests.
 *
 * BEWARE: some tests do not pass if you do not handle the case where the players prop is an empty array, or null.
